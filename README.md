# Quantum Computation

I will be implementing a variety of quantum algorithms in this repository. I will start off with simple well established ones as I learn about the process, then I will experiment with some new ones. 

# Implemented Algorithms

## Deutschâ€“Jozsa algorithm

In this folder I have both a classical (although it's faster because the function is discoverable very early because all 0s is 0 then add 1 and it returns 1, thus after 2 iterations it is discovered to be balanced, however this could be fixed with a better balanced function) and quantum algorithms. I will add explainations at a later date (soon).
